		<h2>Noctis</h2>
		<p>Noctis Lucis Caelum, or "Noct" as he's often referred to, suffered a childhood affliction that has left him able to see a heavenly light that enables him to sense others' deaths. Noctis rejects royal convention and he is thought of a renegade.</p>

		<h2>Gladiolus</h2>
		<p>Gladiolus Amicitia is the eldest son and lord of the noble House Amicitia, which is sworn to protect the crown. Despite this, the bond between "Gladio" and Noctis goes deeper than simply being one of duty, but is instead one of brotherhood.</p>

		<h2>Ignis</h2>
		<p>Ignis Scientia was raised to offer his unwavering voice of reason in counsel to Noctis. Weaned on shrewd logic and a classical education from youth, he and Noctis share a deep mutual understanding and trust built on years of familiarity.</p>

		<h2>Prompto</h2>
		<p>Prompto Argentum is both the youngest member of the group and of modest birth, but has been a long-time friend to Noctis. Being from outside the royal circle has left him with a chip on his shoulder, but he's still eager to help in any way he can.</p>
